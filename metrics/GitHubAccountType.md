GitHub Use Case
<br>
Question: How many commits are made based on GitHub account type and 
how the individual or company is using it.
<br>
Description: Add collection of data about account types and activities by type.  
<br>
Objectives: This may be a useful metric especially for enterprise accounts.  
They will be able to see the number of commits from different users on their account and track changes made.
<br>
Implementation: This information should be provided by GitHub and should be obtainable already.
<br>
Visualization:  The metric would display well as a stacked bar graph.  
One graph would represent individual accounts while a different graph could display an enterprise account.  
Within this graph each bar would represent a period of time.  
Different colors in the stack would represent actions taken by individuals within the account.
